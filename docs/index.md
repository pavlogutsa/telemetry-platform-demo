# Telemetry Platform

This project simulates a remote monitoring / endpoint telemetry system:
- Devices send telemetry.
- We ingest, normalize, and persist it.
- We expose current and historical device state.

This documentation describes architecture, data flow, APIs, infrastructure, security, and release roadmap.
